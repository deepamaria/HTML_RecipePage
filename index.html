        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>     
            An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream, custard or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only. Tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.
            Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.

            This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. I have never seen another one quite like it! It will always be my favorite and has won several first place prizes in local competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for family dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.

        <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 <sup>o</sup> F</li>
                <li>Place the flour , salt and butter in a large bowl</li>
                <li>With a blender or fork cut the butter into flour until it forms tiny balls with <br> the flour. Then slowly add the water </li>
                <li>Knead with floured hands until a large dough ball forms</li>
                <li>Begin to roll the dough out on a floured counter top</li>
                <li>Lift the flattened dough off the counter top slowly</li>
                <li>Unroll the dough over the pan being careful not to let it tear</li>
                <li>Cut off the overhanging edges</li>
                <li>Place the pie shell in the refrigerator.</li>    
            </ul>
                
            <li>Make the filling:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Peel and slice the apples into pieces about quarter of an inch thick or chop them into half cubes. Peel and On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>Assemble the pie: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>    

            <li>Bake the pie:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes. All in all, the pie will bake for about one hour, give or take a few minutes. You'll know the pie is done when the apples are soft and the crust is a beautiful golden brown color.

        <h2>Chef´s Notes</h2>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
        <p>Make a lattice crust:
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
                </li>
            </ul>
